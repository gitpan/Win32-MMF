0.09c
    [INTERNALS]
    - Untie a variable will not erase existing data.
    - Switched from Win32::Semaphore to use own locking mechanism.

0.09
    [INTERNALS]
    - Fixed a problem with ReleaseNamespace that caused Perl to crash randomly
      when destroying an MMF object
    - Switched to Win32::Semaphore for locking, fixed problem with locking
    - Special thanks to extensive Beta testing done by [xiper] at Perl Monks.

    [ENHANCEMENTS]
    - Added more demo and test cases.
    - Created separate POD for Win32::MMF::Shareable.

0.08
    [INTERNALS]
    - Fixed a bug with STORE not reading the shared variable before storing.
    
    [ENHANCEMENTS]
    - Added ability to explicit lock a logical block of code that accesses
      critical information, instead of locking on individual fetch and store,
      which might result in raise condition between several processes.

0.07
    [ENHANCEMENTS]
    - Cleaned up namespace initialization in Win32::MMF::Shareable, the
      Win32::MMF::Shareable module importer will allow named parameters
      passed in to initialize the namespace.

      use Win32::MMF::Shareable { namespace=>'myshare',
                                  swapfile=>'c:/private.swp;,
                                  size=>1024*1024 };

    - Win32::MMF::POD has been updated to reflect the change
    - Added test cases to ensure correct operation of the module under
      different Windows environments

0.06
    [INTERNALS]
    - A design problem was found in the memory management subsystem. Windows
      can map the same MMF to different addresses in different processes.
      Because the original memory manager stores absolute addresses inside
      the MMF namespace, a pointer created in one process is not valid in
      another process. The MMF manager is recoded to operate on relative
      offsets to the beginning of the MMF instead.
      
    [ENHANCEMENTS]
    - The shareable interface has been cleaned up after receiving excellent
      feedbacks from xiper at Perl monks.
    - More demos are added.

0.05
    [INTERNALS]
    - A bug in variable deletion is fixed
    - A bug in malloc (and realloc) is fixed
    - A bug in setvar('varid', '') causes undef warning fixed

    [ENHANCEMENTS]
    - Added tied variable interface: Win32::MMF::Shareable
    - Added many demo codes, including shared perl objects
