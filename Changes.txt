    [ENHANCEMENTS]
    - Cleaned up namespace initialization in Win32::MMF::Shareable, the
      Win32::MMF::Shareable module importer will allow named parameters
      passed in to initialize the namespace.

      use Win32::MMF::Shareable { namespace=>'myshare',
                                  swapfile=>'c:/private.swp;,
                                  size=>1024*1024 };

    - Win32::MMF::POD has been updated to reflect the change
    - Added test cases to ensure correct operation of the module under
      different Windows environments

    [INTERNALS]
    - A design problem was found in the memory management subsystem. Windows
      can map the same MMF to different addresses in different processes.
      Because the original memory manager stores absolute addresses inside
      the MMF namespace, a pointer created in one process is not valid in
      another process. The MMF manager is recoded to operate on relative
      offsets to the beginning of the MMF instead.
      
    [ENHANCEMENTS]
    - The shareable interface has been cleaned up after receiving excellent
      feedbacks from xiper at Perl monks.
    - More demos are added.

    [ENHANCEMENTS]
    - Added tied variable interface: Win32::MMF::Shareable
    - Added many demo codes, including shared perl objects
